\chapter*{Abstract}

The sPHENIX experiment is a next-generation high energy nuclear physics experiment, currently under development for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). It is designed to study the nature of the QGP by measuring fully reconstructed jets  at higher collision rates. 

To meet the experimental demands, the sPHENIX  MASP-based Vertex Detector (MVTX) will provide fast counting rates and a very low material budget with pixel sensors. This detector will enable a high tracking efficiency and excellent impact parameter resolution, ideal for heavy flavor hadron identification and reconstruction at the very high beam collision rates provided by RHIC.

Therefore, in this document, it is proposed to be performed activities on research and development in collaboration with sPHENIX experiment. The research will be focused on the development of the MAPS sensors - recently developed to operate at higher levels of radiation dose - to optimize the device capabilities to operate in the sPHENIX MVTX detector.
